## 🌟 Overview
This is an out-of-the-box (OOTB) solution for Claude's new Computer Use APIs. 

**No Docker** is required, and it supports both **Windows** and **macOS**. This project provides a user-friendly interface based on Gradio. 🎨

For more information, you can visit our [project page](https://computer-use-ootb.github.io). 🌐

## Update
- **[2024/11/20]** We've added some examples to help you get hands-on experience with Claude 3.5 Computer Use.
- **[2024/11/19]** Forget about the single-display limit set by Anthropic - you can now use **multiple displays** 🎉!
- **[2024/11/18]** We've released a deep analysis of Claude 3.5 Computer Use: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10323](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10323).
- **[2024/11/11]** Forget about the low-resolution display limit set by Anthropic — you can now use *any resolution you like* and still keep the **screenshot token cost low** 🎉!
- **[2024/11/11]** Now both **Windows** and **macOS** platforms are supported 🎉!
- **[2024/10/25]** Now you can **Remotely Control** your computer 💻 through your mobile device 📱 — **No Mobile App Installation** required! Give it a try and have fun 🎉.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 0. Prerequisites
- Instal Miniconda on your system through this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download?utm_source=anacondadocs&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=download&utm_content=topnavalldocs). (**Python Version: >= 3.11**).

### 1. Clone the Repository 📂
Open the Conda Terminal. (After installation Of Miniconda, it will appear in the Start menu.)
Run the following command on **Conda Terminal**.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/showlab/computer_use_ootb.git
cd computer_use_ootb
```

### 2. Install Dependencies 🔧
```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the Interface ▶️
```bash
python app.py
```
If you successfully start the interface, you will see two URLs in the terminal:
```bash
* Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
* Running on public URL: https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.gradio.live (Do not share this link with others, or they will be able to control your computer.)
```

### 4. Control Your Computer with Any Device can Access the Internet
- **Computer to be controlled**: The one installed software.
- **Device Send Command**: The one opens the website.
  
Open the website at http://localhost:7860/ (if you're controlling the computer itself) or https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.gradio.live in your mobile browser for remote control.

Enter the Anthropic API key (you can obtain it through this [website](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)), then give commands to let the AI perform your tasks.

## 🖥️ Supported Systems
- **Windows** ✅
- **macOS** ✅

## ⚠️ Risks
- **Potential Dangerous Operations by the Model**: The models' performance is still limited and may generate unintended or potentially harmful outputs. Recommend continuously monitoring the AI's actions. 
- **Cost Control Challenges**: Each task may cost a few dollars. We'll optimize this in the future. 💸

## 📅 Roadmap

### 5. Automate Setup on Windows 11 with PowerShell
To automate the installation of dependencies and setup on Windows 11, you can use the provided PowerShell script `setup.ps1`.

#### Steps to Run the PowerShell Script:
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. Run the following command:
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```
This script will install Miniconda, set up a Conda environment, install Python dependencies from `dev-requirements.txt`, and start the interface.
